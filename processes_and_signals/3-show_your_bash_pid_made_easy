# This script displays the PID along with the process name (extracted to just "bash")
# for processes whose command line contains the word bash.
#
# It uses pgrep to list matching processes and awk to extract the PID and
# the basename of the command (so that "/bin/bash" becomes "bash").

pgrep -a bash | awk '{
  pid = $1;
  # Split the second field (the command) using "/" as separator.
  n = split($2, arr, "/");
  print pid, arr[n];
